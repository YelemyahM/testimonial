      course, and the subiects
      learned were current, If not more
      honestlv feel I dot everv rennu's
      worth</strong>
    <p class="content">" I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a
      transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
      the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
      weeks was the best and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've
      successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "</p>

      as a mobile engineer for a big

    <strong class="empahse">Such a life-changing
      experience. Highly
      recommended!</strong>
    <p class="content">" Before joining the bootcamp, I've
      never written a line of code. I needed
      some structure from professionals
      who can help me learn programming
      step by step. I was encouraged to
      enroll by a former student of theirs
      who can only say wonderful things
      about the program. The entire
      curriculum and staff did not
      disappoint. They were very hands-on
      and I never had to wait long for
      assistance. The agile team project, in
      particular, was outstanding. It took
      my learning to the next level in a way
      that no tutorial could ever have. In
      fact, I've often referred to it during
      interviews as an example of my
      developent experience. It certainly
      helped me land a job as a full-stack
      developer after receiving multiple
      offers. 100% recommend! "</p>
